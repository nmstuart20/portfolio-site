                <p>This project started as a way to automate many of the time consuming and manual tasks involved in designing wire harnesses. 
                   I wrote applications in Java that automated tasks such as selecting wire harness components, seperating wires, and generating reports.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I'm a Senior Engineer within the Aerospace and Defense industry with multiple years of experience. 
               I've had roles in Mission Systems, Electrical Wiring/Power and within the last three years I've worked as a Software Engineer on Sensor Fusion products. 
               In my personal time I like to golf, work out, and learn new things (with this currently being enrolled in the Boston Masters of Software Development).
               I've also recently started a podcast about trying to podium in a Spartan Race (it's called the <a href="https://www.subparathletes.com">Subpar Athletes podcast.</a>)</p>
